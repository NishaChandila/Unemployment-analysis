## Analysis Using Python  
I utilized Python for initial data exploration, cleaning, and analysis. Using libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib, I processed and visualized key trends in unemployment rates. The analysis helped identify seasonal patterns, regional differences, and long-term trends affecting unemployment. Pythonâ€™s data manipulation capabilities made it easier to prepare the data for advanced visualization.

## Power BI Dashboard  
To present the findings interactively, I developed a Power BI dashboard that provides a comprehensive view of unemployment rates across different regions, frequencies, and years. The dashboard features dynamic visualizations, allowing users to explore data trends and insights efficiently. It serves as a valuable tool for decision-makers to monitor and understand unemployment trends in India.
