# Unemployment Rate Analysis in India  

## Objective  
The objective of this project is to analyze unemployment trends in India over a period of time using a comprehensive dataset. This analysis aims to identify patterns, regional disparities, and temporal changes in unemployment rates. By leveraging data-driven insights, we can better understand the key factors influencing employment fluctuations, the economic impact on different regions, and variations based on data frequency. The findings are intended to support policymakers, researchers, and stakeholders in making informed decisions to address unemployment challenges and foster economic growth.

## Analysis Using Python  
I utilized Python for initial data exploration, cleaning, and analysis. Using libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib, I processed and visualized key trends in unemployment rates. The analysis helped identify seasonal patterns, regional differences, and long-term trends affecting unemployment. Pythonâ€™s data manipulation capabilities made it easier to prepare the data for advanced visualization.

## Power BI Dashboard  
To present the findings interactively, I developed a Power BI dashboard that provides a comprehensive view of unemployment rates across different regions, frequencies, and years. The dashboard features dynamic visualizations, allowing users to explore data trends and insights efficiently. It serves as a valuable tool for decision-makers to monitor and understand unemployment trends in India.
